# DRT_Aberration_Compensation
A dimensionality reduction technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed for the aberration and spurious fringe removal from the phase measurement in off-axis digital holographic microscopy.

The repository contains a demo code for aberration removal from the simulated cells as the phase object.
funcDRT.m contains the original aberration compensation code
zernfun2.m is used to simulate the aberration term
Unwrap_TIE_DCT_Iter.m is the phase unwrapping code.

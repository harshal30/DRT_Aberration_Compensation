# DRT_Aberration_Compensation

This repository contains a demo MATLAB implementation of an aberration compensation algorithm for off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM). The approach leverages a **dimensionality reduction technique based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to remove aberrations and spurious fringes from reconstructed phase images.
